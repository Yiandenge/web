            <h1>Italians 'relieved' to get supplies from China<a class="test">test</a></h1>
                <p>People in Italy, where some medical supplies are running low due to the coronavirus outbreak, have expressed their appreciation for China's help after a planeload of needed supplies arrived.

                <br/ class="br"> is now the hardest-hit nation after China, with more than 1,400 deaths from COVID-19 and over 21,000 confirmed cases since the outbreak began there on Feb 21, according to the Associated Press.
                
                <br>China delivered the planeload of medical supplies, including masks and respirators, to Italy to help it deal with its growing crisis.
                
                <br>"In this moment of great stress, of great difficulty, we are relieved to have this arrival of supplies. It is true that it will help only temporarily, but it is still important," said the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca.
                
                <br>"We have a desperate need for these masks right now. We need respirators (that will be donated to the government). This is for sure a really important donation for our country," Rocca added.
                
                <br>A team of nine Chinese medical workers arrived in Rome late on Thursday, along with about 30 metric tons of equipment, on a flight organized by the Red Cross Society of China.
                
                <br>Lu Ming, a member of the team who also works with the National Health Commission's international cooperation department, said: "To bring down the mortality rate is a priority in disease control, especially given that we're coping with an emerging virus. So we have dispatched the most competent experts in treating severe and critical cases to Italy.
                
                <br>"We're willing to share hard-won diagnosis and treatment guidelines with Italians, and we also hope that our Italian colleagues will be able to enforce proper quarantine of infected cases and general epidemic control measures," Lu was quoting by China Radio International as saying.
                
                <br>"We have also carried plasma and blood products from recovered Chinese patients," Lu added. Using such infusions of blood plasma in infected patients is believed to be an effective therapeutic approach.
                
                <br>Italy's outbreak risks overwhelming the nation's hospitals, and some key supplies are running low, Reuters reported.
                
                <br>"I appreciate a lot this lovely gesture from China," Eva Dal Pozzo, a senior business consultant in Italy, told Xinhua News Agency. She described the shipment as vital, since the nation's factories do not have sufficient production capacity.
                
                <br>Reuters reported that none of Italy's partners in the European Union responded to Rome's requests for help with medical supplies as they looked to protect their own supplies of masks and other equipment.
                
                <br>The aid from China included nine pallets loaded with tens of thousands of masks, respiratory materials, electrocardiographs and other medical supplies.
                
                <br>Cinzia Pasquale, a senior consultant on European Union affairs living in Lombardy, was quoted by Xinhua as saying, "Seeing how China has managed the outbreak in Wuhan, I am personally very confident of the contribution that the Chinese medical staff will make to the heroic Italian doctors who have been overwhelmed by this health emergency."
                
                <br>Meanwhile, Italy has closed all shops except food stores and pharmacies in Europe's toughest lockdown yet as virus deaths and cases continued to rise.
                
                <br>Italy imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 9, a day after quarantine measures were imposed on a large northern area of the nation.
                
                <br>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the impact of the tightened restrictions would still take another couple of weeks to show.
                
                <br>"We are facing an emergency, a national emergency," he said in a televised address to announce the new restrictions. "We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed."
                
                <br>All religious, cultural and sporting events were suspended, and cruise ships are not allowed to dock at Italian ports. The restrictions are expected to remain in place until April 3.
                
                <br>Massimo Bray, a former Italian culture minister, said on social media that China's provision of medical material and expertise was a "great support" at a difficult time.
                
                <br>Italians have also taken to social media to express their gratitude for the arrival of the Chinese medical aid and expertise.
                
                <br>Meanwhile, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Italy was making "genuine sacrifices" in the global fight against the virus.
                
                <br>The WHO said in a statement, "Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well."</p>

            <h1>Epidemic reveals countries' true character<a class="test">test</a></h1>
                <p>The world has a Public Enemy No 1, and it's the novel coronavirus.

                Capable of causing severe pneumonia among those it infects, the virus first wreaked havoc on Wuhan, Hubei province and has since spread at an alarming rate. At present, thousands have died and tens of thousands have been infected in dozens of countries, leading the World Health Organization to declare an official pandemic.
                
                As the number of infected continues to rise, broader questions are being asked of governance systems all over the world. One can examine the responses of two countries, for instance, and reveal far more about these places than their philosophies on crisis management — we can dig even deeper, and learn their foundational values.
                
                Let's be honest, though. When it comes to surface-level analysis, there's plenty to look at. To take one example, only a few thousand have been lab-tested for the virus in the United States, with thousands more stuck in long queues or being sent home despite exhibiting telltale symptoms. (For no particular reason I'm reminded China can test 1.6 million people each week, according to a WHO estimate.)
                
                Even with that morsel of information it should be clear the US is not equipped to deal with a crisis of this magnitude. But the epidemic is also laying bare inadequacies and inequalities that have plagued the country for decades — the inherent shortcomings of a system that prioritizes private profit over public health. These exacerbate the spread of a potentially deadly virus in a near-infinite number of ways.
                
                Health insurance companies have said they will cover costs for testing, but not treatment — an inadequate solution if there ever was one. Why would someone who's sick go through a test if they know they can't afford to get better? This doesn't even include the millions of people in the US without any insurance at all. Advice for them seems limited to "good luck." Insurers and healthcare providers must be compelled to forego profit-seeking and give treatment to all who need it at no cost. Full, universal coverage is the only way people will feel safe going to the hospital, and that's what it will take to eradicate the disease.
                
                As bad as the healthcare situation is, the problems don't end there. With no paid sick leave policy in place and Congress arguing over the bill that would provide it, millions of workers will have no choice but to go to their jobs even if they're showing symptoms. Professions that routinely deny benefits are, in a terrible irony, often the ones that involve the most human contact. Service industry employees, with bills to pay and without the financial security to stay home, will become walking disease vectors.
                
                The workplace isn't the only flashpoint for this epidemic. Schools and universities, with barely a word of warning, are closing their doors. Impoverished students in the US rely on primary and secondary schools for a free meal, and of these many are classified as homeless — over 100,000 in New York City alone. Without a plan to cover this shortfall, countless children will go hungry.
                
                College students in dormitories are not allowed to stay in their housing and must return home, but again, quite a few don't have the means to get there. Harvard University, that venerable institution with a $38 billion endowment, has emptied its dorms and forced undergraduates on financial aid to turn to alumni and student networks to cover relocation and rehousing costs. I guess it's out of the question for some of those billions to be used to keep a roof over students' heads.
                
                This is only a sampling of the knock-on effects of the pandemic we're seeing happen in real time. There are jail and prison populations that are extremely vulnerable to an outbreak, as some overburdened facilities don't even provide soap or hand sanitizer to inmates. If utility bills go unpaid by people who are sick or who can't go to work, widespread electricity shutdowns will lead to greater misery and death. The list goes on.
                
                But it doesn't have to be this way. We have an excellent example of the right approach to an epidemic of this size and scale. China reacted swiftly and decisively once the gravity of the situation became clear. Testing and treatment were made free, and new temporary hospitals were constructed in record time in epidemic hotspots. Electricity, wireless and heating services pledged not to cut customers off for non-payment. State industries redirected production toward essential goods and medical supplies. Workers who could did their jobs from home, and service employees were deployed in parallel industries like delivery to keep employment and wages up. At no point were daily necessities hard to come by — yes, even toilet paper.
                
                The combination of mass social distancing and centralized quarantine for confirmed patients has effectively snuffed out the epidemic in the place that was hardest hit. The measures China took bought precious weeks for the rest of the world to prepare for the inevitable spread of a highly contagious virus. Tragically, quite a few countries ignored the warning and instead spent that time criticizing China for what they branded an "authoritarian" response. Commentators salivated at the prospect of the country's economy collapsing instead of asking what could be learned from its experience containing the virus. But that's to be expected. In the capitalist imagination, cutthroat competition takes priority over cooperation and solidarity.
                
                Most upsetting about the US' slipshod handling of the outbreak is the fact those responsible won't be the ones who suffer for it. They are wealthy and powerful. They enjoy top-flight healthcare and can sequester themselves at a moment's notice with no concern for their material needs. It's poor and working people who will bear the brunt of this crisis in lost wages and employment, in outrageous medical bills, in family and friends who don't survive.
                
                The pandemic is revealing the true nature of the world's economic systems. Some have shown they value health and human life above all else. Others, it seems, find death too profitable to make any meaningful changes.
                
                In the coming weeks we'll be seeing the human cost of that cruel moral calculus. Without support from institutions meant to be relied on in times of crisis, the people of the US will have to band together and solve these problems themselves.

            <h1>US repression of Chinese press serves no one's interest<a class="test">test</a></h1>
                <p>The US State Department’s decision on Monday to put a personnel cap on five Chinese news outlets operating in the country is the latest move to sabotage bilateral exchanges achieved in previous decades.

                Like other international news organizations in the US —many of which are also government-funded — Chinese news outlets have played a critical role in helping the US public understand China and the world with their unique perspectives.
                
                Having worked as China Daily correspondent in the US for more than eight years, I have no doubt about that role. My confidence comes in part from the positive words on my work from top China scholars such as Jeff Bader, Jerry Cohen and the late Dick Solomon, although they were critical of the Chinese government from time to time.
                
                Some scholars I profiled started their China study in the 1960s, when the two countries had no diplomatic ties. They could not visit the Chinese mainland but went to Hong Kong, then a British colony, to talk to anyone they could grab coming from the mainland. Sometimes a mainland newspaper used to wrap fish became a valuable source of information for them.
                
                Such a miserable time of no contact or exchange is long gone. However, the current US administration is going back in that direction by rapidly undoing many good bilateral exchange programs.
                
                Under President Barack Obama just a few years ago, the two countries also faced many challenges, from cybersecuity to the South China Sea. But the Obama administration still invited the China military to participate in RIMPAC, a multi-national naval drill, for the first time in 2014 and again in 2016.
                
                I covered RIMPAC in Hawaii. I also witnessed the 10-year visa agreement between the two countries in November 2014 and interviewed Edmund Downie, a Yale University graduate student, who was the first to be issued such a visa in Washington.
                
                With the visa policy, more Chinese are able to see the US for themselves, instead of learning about it from dramatized Hollywood movies.
                
                I was also there in early 2014, when US launched the 100,000 Strong initiative to encourage more students to study in China. Obama, Vice-President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry all spoke highly of the program. Kerry and his predecessor Hillary Clinton were also supportive of the Confucius Institute, which teaches Chinese language, culture and history.
                
                SelectUSA Summit, a US government program launched in 2013 to attract foreign direct investment, had for years been enthusiastic in attracting Chinese FDI.
                
                These are just some of the many bilateral exchanges that have experienced dramatic setbacks in the past three years. The US no longer invites China for RIMPAC. It has tightened visa policy, and demonized Confucius Institutes and Chinese FDI.
                
                The 33 percent favorable rating of China among US public in a Gallup poll released on Monday is shocking, but it is partly a result of the escalating smear campaign against China by US politicians.
                
                Surveys over the years by the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, in collaboration with the National Geographic and Gallup, showed regrettably low scores in global literacy among US adults and college graduates.
                
                The latest US crackdown on Chinese journalists not only goes against the freedom of the press, it also undermines an important channel to keep the US public informed of the most consequential bilateral relations of the 21st century.
                
                Such a reactionary move to cut those hard-won achievements in bilateral exchange may make it easier for some politicians to manipulate public opinion, but it does not serve the US national interest, the interests of China or the world.

                <h1>Overseas Chinese get help from physicians back home<a class="test">test</a></h1>
                <p>With China getting the COVID-19 epidemic under control, more Chinese doctors here have joined hands to help the global community, especially overseas Chinese, better contain the fast-spreading pandemic.

                In Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, which is the hometown of over 700,000 overseas Chinese, most of whom live in European countries like Italy and Spain, a team of more than 20 doctors from Wenzhou Central Hospital have been offering medical advice to overseas Chinese including on how to contain the virus. The doctors had all taken part in the city's fight against the epidemic a month ago.
                
                At least seven WeChat groups, each with the maximum 500 members, were launched for overseas Chinese within two days in early March, with questions from each group being answered by doctors in Wencheng county in Wenzhou, said Li Shunhua, deputy director of the county's health bureau.
                
                So far, more than 40 such WeChat groups have been launched to provide relief and professional medical advice to over 15,000 overseas Chinese from Wencheng.
                
                Yang Zhengfei, 61, who live in Sardinia, Italy, said such online consultation has been a great relief.
                
                "We Chinese here are really in a panic-Italy is the hardest-hit country in Europe. In addition, confirmed cases have recently been reported here," he said.
                
                "Most Chinese here can't speak Italian, so it's nice to have doctors from our hometown answering our questions and relieving our panic and anxiety. I've recommended the service to all the Chinese here," he said.
                
                The Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, in Hangzhou, launched similar services on Wednesday, allowing overseas Chinese to access domestic doctors through apps such as Alipay.
                
                Doctors from the hospital are available online from 6 pm to 11 pm daily, and each inquiry should be answered within 24 hours, according to the hospital.
                
                In Anhui province, Zhao Hong, a doctor at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, has offered free medical consultation to over 100 Chinese in Venice, Italy, and in Belgium.
                
                "Many Chinese here previously contacted me and tried to fly back to China for fear of the fast-spreading pandemic in Europe. Now they said they felt at ease after consulting Zhao," said Zhang Jiabao, a Chinese resident of Venice.
